The project contains a Movie Page where you can search as many movies as you want, Home Page and a Favorite section. The first part of the project contains a Home page with a slider image function that shows new movie poster which keeps on getting updated in every 5 second and a most popular movie section showing popular or trending movies list with poster + title + rating + details. In the second part we can search any movie by just typing. Search-bar will auto suggest movies based on your typing again with poster and a short description. Third part contains the Movies Page showing details about the Movie which user searched. I have created Movies page with overlay effect and added a favorite button in it.
The next challenge is to make a favorite page which stores the movies which user select and show them in a different page.

# Features


## Home Page
- Search any movie from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like Google does for suggestions).
- Each search result of the movie have a favourite button, clicking on which the movie added to “My favourite movies” (a list).
- On clicking any particular search result (any movie), open a new page with more information about that movie (movie page)
